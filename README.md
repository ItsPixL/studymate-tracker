# StudyMate¬†üìö

_A minimal Python + React JS study‚Äëtime tracker for both terminal lovers and UI fans trying to improve their focus and learning._  
StudyMate helps you focus on your learning by tracking study sessions, timing them, and showing your progress.

- Whether you like the **simplicity of the CLI** or the **polish of a web UI**, StudyMate has you covered.
- Log each study session by **subject**, **date**, and **duration** then shows weekly and all‚Äëtime summaries.
- Use the built-in **timer**, **pomodoro**, or **stopwatch** to focus on your learning.

## üñ•Ô∏è‚ÄØQuick¬†Start

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ItsPixL/studymate-tracker.git
cd studymate-tracker
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Choose your mode (SETUP ONLY)

#### CLI mode (SETUP ONLY)

```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

#### GUI mode (SETUP ONLY)

```bash
# Backend setup
cd backend
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Frontend setup
cd ../frontend/studymate-frontend
npm install
npm run build

# Run Flask server
cd ../backend
python app.py
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Lock in!

You're all setup! Now you can:

- Add some subjects
- Log a session manually
- Use the built-in timers to focus
- Watch your stats (and grades) grow

#### Start CLI

```bash
cd backend
python main.py
```

#### Start GUI

```bash
cd backend
python app.py
```

Both the GUI and CLI work simultaneously, so you can easily switch between them! All your data is stored in `backend/data/sessions.json` and `backend/data/subjects.json` and nothing is sent to any servers or anything external (the app can run fully offline)!

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

Here are common things that might go wrong:

### 1. "Unexpected token '<'" is not valid JSON"

This usually happens if the backend is serving the HTML fallback page instead of JSON.

- Check that the backend is running before making requests.
- Ensure the API endpoint URL is correct in your frontend config.

### 2. "ModuleNotFoundError"

- Make sure your virtual environment is activated (source venv/bin/activate or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows).
- Install requirements again using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### 3. Frontend not updating after changes

- Rebuilt the frontend using `npm run build` (inside the frontend/studymate-frontend/ folder)

## ü§ñ A Note on AI Use

AI has been used in this project, but very minimally. ChatGPT was used in creating this README, as well as generating the idea and general development roadmap. However, no AI was used for code or debugging - this was all done manually using documentation and lots of trial and error.
